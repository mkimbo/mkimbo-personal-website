- In November 2019, I embarked on a journey to self-teach myself software development using the JavaScript programming language.</p>

* I learned the basics of the language then decided to major on REACT, one of its popular front-end libraries that can be used to develop the View in the MVC architecture.</p>

* To master React I had to do several practical projects some of which are on my github profile. I also had to learn supporting technologies such as NodeJS and Redux for state management.</p>

* Diving deeper into React I discovered Gatsby JS and the JAMSTACK architecture. Gatsby is an incredibly fast React-based static-site generator that makes a React application 1000x better :).</p>

* Gatsby enables easy intergration of Image Optimization, Search Engine Optimization (SEO) and data fetching capalibities using Graphql to react applications with some example projects on my github as well.</p>

* I am now a freelance developer looking to put my skills to more practical use. Hire me for all your web presence needs.</p>
